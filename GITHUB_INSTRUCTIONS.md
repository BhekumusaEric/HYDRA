# GitHub Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push Project HYDRA to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "project-hydra" (or your preferred name)
   - Make it public or private according to your preference
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub (replace `username` with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project-hydra.git
   ```

3. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Verify that your code is now on GitHub by visiting:
   ```
   https://github.com/username/project-hydra
   ```

## After Pushing to GitHub

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. Enable GitHub Pages to display the project website
2. Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
3. Add collaborators to your project
4. Create issues for tracking tasks from NEXT_STEPS.md
5. Set up project boards to organize development

## Updating the Repository

After making changes to your local code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```

## Branching Strategy

For future development:

1. Create a branch for each feature or phase:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/phase-2-exploit-module
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement Phase 2 exploit generation"
   ```

3. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/phase-2-exploit-module
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch
